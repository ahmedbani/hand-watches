      A watch showcases the wearer’s personality. It can also convey his taste, wealth and even humor.
Choosing a watch is so overwhelming. There are so many things to consider. Having an appropriate watch for any event in your life will ensure that you really are dressing the part wherever life takes you.
Watches need to be looked after thoroughly. Many things can affect your watch, dust, wind, and a lot more. Keeping them away from these elements and storing them the right way isn’t that difficult. A watch case allows you to organize and store your watches, thus maintaining them when they’re not in use.

       <p>Analog watches have displays with a miniature clock-face with 12 hours, an hour hand, and a minute hand. Some analog watches also have a second hand. There are analog watches with traditional numbers and analog watches with Roman numerals. Most analog watches have marks representing the 60 minutes in an hour. Also, called as Analogue Watch.</p>

      <p>An automatic watch is a watch that continues to operate due to the regular motion of the wearer’s wrist. Automatic wristwatches don’t need winding if worn daily. The energy is stored by using a half-disc metal weight, called a rotor, that spins when the arm is moved. This energy is used to power the watch and can keep the watch going at night or while the watch isn’t being worn. Stored energy in an automatic wristwatch can keep an unworn watch running for 24 to 48 hours. Also, called as Self-Winding Watch.</p>

      <p>“Chronograph” is just a fancy word for “stopwatch.” Using a chronograph is easy. You just press the start/stop button on the side of the watch to start or stop the stopwatch; push the bottom button to reset back to zero. The chronograph function on chrono watch dials lets you time races and events.</p>

      <p>Diving Watch is a watch designed for underwater diving that features, water resistance greater upto 100 m (330 ft). The typical diver’s watch will have a water resistance of around 200 to 300 m (660 to 980 ft), though modern technology allows the creation of diving watches that can go much deeper. Also, called as Dive Watch or Diver’s Watch.</p>

      <p>A dress watch is the most elegant of watches. It has one purpose and that’s to tell time. It need not have complications.

A dress watch needs to be simplistic. Elegant. And above all, minimalistic. It isn’t some gaudy watch that’s bejeweled with diamonds or a chronograph that is so big it looks like a clock. It is subtle, understated and charming. They aren’t intended to be worn with jeans and a t-shirt; to the gym; or bowling on Saturday night. It pairs with your business suit, your dinner jacket, and in some cases, a tuxedo.</p>

     <p>A quartz watch is powered by an electronic oscillator synchronized by quartz crystal. The electric current causes the quartz inside to pulsate with a precise frequency. The frequency is broken down through an integrated circuit where power is released through a small stepping motor setting the watch hands in motion. Quartz watches will need battery replacements from time to time.</p>

      <p>A mechanical watch is a watch that uses a mechanism to measure the passage of time, as opposed to modern quartz watches which function electronically. It is driven by a spring (called a mainspring) which must be wound periodically. This makes the ‘ticking’ sound characteristic of all mechanical watches.</p>
